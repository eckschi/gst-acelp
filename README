TETRA ACELP Encoder Plugin

NOTE:
plugins can be installed locally by using "$HOME" as prefix:

  $ meson --prefix="$HOME" build/
  $ ninja -C build/ install

However be advised that the automatic scan of plugins in the user home
directory won't work under gst-build devenv.

example launch

gst-launch-1.0 -v filesrc location=/tmp/fight_m.mp3 ! decodebin ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! acelpenc ! filesink location=/tmp/foo.celp
